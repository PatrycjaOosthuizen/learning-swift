    var isOverdrawn: Bool {
        return balance < 0

/*
ðŸ“Œ Key Takeaways on Computed Properties
- Computed properties do not store values; they calculate them dynamically.
- No set method is needed unless you also want to allow modifying the property.
- Can be written in a long version (with return) or a shorter version (implicit return).
- Computed properties are useful for converting values, calculating data dynamically, and formatting strings.
