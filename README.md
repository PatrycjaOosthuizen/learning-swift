## 📂 About This Repository

This repository is a collection of my code snippets, mini-projects, and full-scale applications developed as part of **The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu. It includes hands-on exercises and projects covering core iOS development concepts such as Swift programming, UIKit, SwiftUI, Core Data, networking, APIs, Firebase integration, ARKit, and CoreML. This repo serves both as a personal learning archive and a showcase of the practical skills I’ve acquired throughout the course.
